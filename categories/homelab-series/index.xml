      <description>Idea behind Homelab series is to describe how to easily setup multiple hyper-v machines for your homelab.
People ussualy buy and setup multiple raspberry PI to learn. That is awesome, sometimes cumbersome and also expensive. This solution assumes you already have a strong desktop PC with lot of RAM and free HDD space. If you are lacking in RAM department for around 80 Euros you can get 16 Gigs of RAM.</description>
